## Description

Inside Airbnb is an impartial and non-commercial resource that provides a suite of tools and data for investigating the genuine utilization of Airbnb in cities worldwide. Through the examination of publicly accessible data pertaining to a city's Airbnb listings, Inside Airbnb presents filters and essential metrics. This platform aims to offer insights into how Airbnb is employed, particularly in its interaction with the residential housing market.

This project endeavors to sharpen your skills in data analysis and visualization using Python, specifically through the utilization of Pandas and Matplotlib. In the context of Airbnb listings in Singapore, we will explore two datasets: "Detailed Listings Data" and "Detailed Review Data." These datasets contain crucial information about listings and reviews, forming the basis for a comprehensive and hands-on learning experience. By delving into these datasets, you will gain valuable insights and practical experience in analyzing Airbnb data, honing your proficiency in Python for data-related tasks.
